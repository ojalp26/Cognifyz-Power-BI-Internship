# Cognifyz-Power-BI-Internship
This repository contains my work from the Power BI Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. During this internship, I worked on analyzing investment preferences and financial behaviors using Power BI. The project involved data exploration, visualization, and dashboard creation, helping to derive insights from large datasets.
